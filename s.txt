I can't outrun my fate, it follows like a shadow. I put all of my faith, in a saint without a halo. But I won't die pretending, I'm not intending, to see this through. Until I too, become invisible to you.
Endlessly, my mind is slowly wandering and I'm, far away, I've found my way right back to here in time. Restlessly, await the dawn and shut out all the light. Drift away, it's only you tonight...
